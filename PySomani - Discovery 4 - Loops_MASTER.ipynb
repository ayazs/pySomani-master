In computer programming, logic is how you tell the computer to do something if some condition is met.\n","\n","If that sounds complicated, it's not. You have already been programming with logic in your while-loops. For example, in this line of code,\n","```python\n","while guess != theRightNumber :\n","```\n","you told the while-loop to continue repeating as long as the value of the variable ``guess`` is not equal to the value of ``theRightNumber``.
