In this discovery we will start learning about repetition and conditions, which is the whole point of why computers were invented in the first place.\n","\n","The word _repetition_ means to repeat something over and over and over again. Computers can do this really fast and with exacting precision using _loops_. That's what makes them especially useful to humans.\n","\n","Alongside this, computers have the ability to make decisions based on rules. The rules are embedded in the programming that we provide in our code using _logic_ statements.\n","\n","In this discovery you will learn the power of **loops and logic**.
